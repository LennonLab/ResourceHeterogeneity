Resource heterogeneity structures aquatic bacterial communities

## Goal

Community diversity is strongly affected by the bottom-up effects of resource availability. However, because resource pools often exist as heterogeneous mixtures of individual resources, resource heterogeneity may also affect the diversity of local communities. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed bacterial communities in lakes that spanned a resource concentration gradient. In addition, we characterized resource heterogeneity in these lakes using high-resolution mass spectrometry of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool (ecosystem metabolomics). Using these data, we will tested for relationships between the available resources and the aquatic heterotrophic bacteria community and used co-occurrence analysis to test for bacteria-resource interactions.
